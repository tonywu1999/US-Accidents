# US ACCIDENTS SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION

Co-Authors: Anthony Wu, Erlun Lian, Amy Liang, Caroline Hoerrner, Coco Cai

Run the code on team17.ipynb to see the results of our classification methods.

To see the visualization of our results, you can look at the image called 
"Map USA.png". 4 denotes the highest severity of accidents while 1 denotes the 
lowest severity of accidents.  Regions are shaded from 1 through 4 based on 
their projected severity from our classifier.  We calculated that our 
algorithm produced 82% accuracy in classifying severity of certain regions. 

Data we used on US Accidents can be found on kaggle:
